# Energy Consumption Dashboard

This project presents an interactive dashboard for visualizing global energy consumption using various parameters such as country, region, and energy source.
The dashboard is designed to provide insights into both energy consumption (in KWH) and consumer service usage (CSU).

## **Overview**

The dashboard contains the following visualizations:

- **CSU by Country**: Consumer service usage per country.
- **KWH by Country**: Energy consumption (KWH) per country.
- **KWH by Energy Source**: Energy consumption based on source (Biomass, Geothermal, Hydro, Solar, Wind).
- **KWH by Region**: Regional breakdown of energy consumption.
- **CSU by Region**: Regional breakdown of consumer service usage.
- **CSU by Energy Source**: Consumer service usage by energy type.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Snowflake**: For data warehousing and SQL-based analytics.
- **AWS S3**: Used to store raw and processed data files.
- **Tableau / BI Tool**: Used to create the interactive visual dashboard.

## **How to Use**

1. Ensure your data is correctly stored and structured in AWS S3.
2. Use Snowflake to query and transform the data as needed.
3. Connect your BI tool (e.g., Tableau or Power BI) to Snowflake.
4. Build the visuals using the prepared data and structure the dashboard layout as shown above.
